# TryHackMe: Introduction to Offensive Security

## Date Completed:
July 2025

## What I Learned:
- Offensive security focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities ethically
- The hacking process: reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, covering tracks
- Key tools: Nmap (scanning), Hydra (password brute-force), Burp Suite (web testing), Kali Linux (attack environment)

## Tools Used:
- TryHackMe interactive labs
- Kali Linux (browser-based)
- Nmap
- Hydra
- Burp Suite

## Reflections:
This room gave me my first hands-on experience with the offensive side of cybersecurity. I learned how attackers think and how to simulate attacks in a safe environment. Using tools like Nmap and Burp Suite helped me understand how vulnerable systems can be identified and tested. I'm looking forward to digging deeper into each phase of the attack process as I continue learning.
